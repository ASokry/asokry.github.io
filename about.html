					<p>Hello world, I'm Anthony Sokry. I'm a programmer, software developer, and digital media artist. I have a BFA in Digital Media Arts with a minor in Computer Science from SJSU.

					<br><br>
					While at the university, I found my passion for programming and acquired many technical skills. I am well-versed in many programming languages including Java, C#, and Python. I am familiar with many softwares ranging from Adobe Suites and Autodesk Applications to Github and the Unity Engine. I've oversaw gallery installations and established art exhibitions as the project manager. I have also developed websites, set agendas, assigned tasks, and coordinated events for student organizations as various officers positions ranging from Web Director to President. In addition, I worked with Cadre Media Lab to update the program's website as the web developer assistant.
					<br><br>
					I enjoy programming, pop culture, storytelling, and playing games. Some things that inspire me are ideas of play, intersubjectivity, social bonding, and interaction. When I'm not working on projects, I explore the outdoors and spend time with friends.

							<h3 class="hobby-title">Game Development</h3>
							<p>I've had many fond memories playing games growing up. Playing board games with my parents on rainy days, playing hand games with my classmates in elementary, and of course playing video games with my brother and friends. It's how I got introduced into coding. They were engaging, creative, and fun. So I develop games in my free time as a way for me to practice my programming skills, express myself, and explore interesting concepts. My goal is to eventually make a game that can give players fond memories as it did for me.</p>

							<h3 class="hobby-title">Creative Coding</h3>
							<p>In the digital media art program, I was introduced to a varity of ways to make art through technology. For me I found programming to be the most enjoying and learned how to make expressive works use code. Even now, I do creative coding with different programming languages and libraries to see what I can make. I also personally find it more fun and engaging to learn code by make something with it and play with it rather then listening to a lecture.</p>

							<p>Games are fun! I've played video games since I was a kid. It's my "go-to" activity when I'm hanging out with friends or when I need a break from coding. I enjoy games for its many stories and lore, for the immersion, and for social bonding moments.</p>

							<p>I spend a lot of time on my computer - working on code, checking emails, or playing games. Sometimes it just nice to step awawy from your machines and just enjoy life. I enjoy the outdoors, going on hikes on trails, walking in the park, and viewing beautiful, natural scenes.</p>
