					<h1 class="about-greet">About Me<span><hr></span></h1>
					<p>Hello world, I'm Anthony Sokry! I'm a programmer, frontend developer, and digital media artist. I enjoy programming, pop culture references, listening to all kinds of stories, and playing all types of games ranging from video games and tabletop games to hand games. Some things that inspire me are ideas of play, intersubjectivity, social bonding, and interaction.
					<br><br>
					I have a BFA in Digital Media Arts and a minor is Computer Science from SJSU, where I found my passion for programming. I possess a wide range of technical skills, including working knowledge of different programming languages and libraries, experience operating machines for design and manufacturing, familiarity with web applications, and practical use of game development software. I've also coordinated exhibition setups, scheduled agendas and meetings for student organizations, and updated websites as a web developer assistant. 
					<br><br>
					When I'm not working on projects, I enjoy visiting new restaurants and trying new dishes, being outdoors, and hanging out with friends.

							<h3 class="hobby-title">Game Development</h3>
							<p>I've had many fond memories playing games growing up. Playing board games with my parents on rainy days, playing hand games with my classmates in elementary, and of course playing video games with my brother and friends. It's how I got introduced into coding. They were engaging, creative, and fun. So I develop games in my free time as a way for me to practice my programming skills, express myself, and explore interesting concepts. My goal is to eventually make a game that can give players fond memories as it did for me.</p>

							<h3 class="hobby-title">Creative Coding</h3>
							<p>In the digital media art program, I was introduced to a varity of ways to make art through technology. For me I found programming to be the most enjoying and learned how to make expressive works use code. Even now, I do creative coding with different programming languages and libraries to see what I can make. I also personally find it more fun and engaging to learn code by make something with it and play with it rather then listening to a lecture.</p>

							<p>Games are fun! I've played video games since I was a kid. It's my "go-to" activity when I'm hanging out with friends or when I need a break from coding. I enjoy games for its many stories and lore, for the immersion, and for social bonding moments.</p>
