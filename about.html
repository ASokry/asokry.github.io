					<h1 class="about-greet">About Me<span><hr></span></h1>
					<p>Hello world, I'm Anthony Sokry. I'm a programmer, software developer, and digital media artist. I have a BFA in Digital Media Arts with a minor in Computer Science from SJSU.

					<br><br>
					While at the university, I found my passion for programming and acquired many technical skills. I am well-versed in many programming languages including Java, C#, and Python. I am familiar with many software ranging from the Adobe suite and Autodesk applications to GitHub and the Unity engine. I've oversaw gallery installations and established art exhibitions as the project manager. I have also developed websites, set agendas, assigned tasks, and coordinated events for student organizations as various officers positions including Web Director and President. In addition, I worked with <a href="https://cadre.sjsu.edu/" target="_blank">Cadre Media Lab</a> to update the program's website as the web developer assistant.
					<br><br>
					I enjoy programming, pop culture, storytelling, and playing games. Some things that inspire me are ideas of play, intersubjectivity, social bonding, and interaction. When I'm not working on projects, I explore the outdoors and spend time with friends.

							<h3 class="hobby-title">Game Development</h3>
							<p>Growing up, I played board games with my family on rainy days, played hand games with my classmates in elementary, and explored video  games with my brother and friends. It's how I got interested in the ideas of play and motivated to explore some of my own ideas. I develop games in my free time as a way for me to practice my programming skills, to express myself, and to explore interesting concepts. I aspire to make a game that gives players fond memories as it did for me.</p>

							<h3 class="hobby-title">Creative Coding</h3>
							<p>In the digital media art program, I was introduced to a variety of ways to make art through technology. I found programming to be the most enjoyable for me and learned how to make expressive works using code. Even now, I do creative coding with different programming languages and libraries to see what I can create. I personally find it more fun and engaging to learn code by making something and playing with it rather than listening to a lecture.</p>

							<p>Games are fun! I've played video games since I was a kid. It's my "go-to" activity when I'm hanging out with friends or when I need a break from coding. I enjoy games for its many stories, entertaining gameplay, immersive experience, and for its social bonding moments.</p>

							<p>I spend a lot of time on my computer - working on code, checking emails, or playing games. Sometimes it's just nice to step away from machines and go outside. I enjoy the great outdoors: walking in the park, going on hikes, and viewing beautiful, natural scenes.</p>
