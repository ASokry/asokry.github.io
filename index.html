					My passion is games: card, board, sport, hand, and video. I enjoy pop culture, observing concept art, and hearing all kinds of storiesâ€”legends, history, fairy tales, novels, etc. I primarily work in creative coding, web development, hardware programming, and video game scripting. My work is an interpretation and representation of my passion and everything that I define as magnificent. It is a reflection of my commitment and dedication to game design, as well as conceptual design, and, above all, my drive to create unique combinations of art and programming. 
				</p>

				<p>
					As I begin a project, I start by conceiving a goal or objective to reach as well as a way of achieving it. Once I've decided on how to proceed forward with my work I begin to play around or reverse engineer any code I've written or looked at. This sometimes results in unexpected, but not necessarily unwanted outputs which inspires me to dive in deeper into the code I'm working with.
				</p>

				<p>
					My goal is to work in video game design and development to create worlds and enjoyable gameplay. Something fun and interactive, yet compelling and worthwhile that I can give to everyone. I continue to collect more knowledge pertaining to the arts and programming, all in pursuit of becoming an excellent game designer.
